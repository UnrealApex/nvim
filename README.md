### About
This repo just contains my Neovim configuration. Like most config files, my `init.vim` contains the configurations that make Neovim feel at home for me.
You can use my configuration if you wish but acknowledge that some config options are specific to my machine like paths to executables and if you clone it, you will need to make appropriate modifications to it.

### Plugins
I have several plugins to enhance my experience using Neovim. As a side note, this config and its plugins are not all compatible with Vim, if you're using Vim, see my [`.vimrc`](/.vimrc). Also, I use [Neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide) as my GUI client.
My plugins are managed using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
If you use my config and [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is not present on your system, it will automatically install it.
The plugins I use are [here](https://github.com/UnrealApex/dotfiles/blob/main/plugins/plug.vim#L12).
