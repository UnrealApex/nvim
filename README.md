### About
This repo just contains my Neovim configuration. Like most config files, the files in this repository include the configurations that make Neovim fit my needs.

You're free to copy my config but it is generally frowned upon because people's editor preferences tend to be different. Rather, if you are interested in using my config, I suggest borrowing snippets that you like from this repo.
That being said, suggestions are definitely open!

### Plugins
I have several plugins to enhance my experience using Neovim. As a side note, this config only works in Neovim, if you're using Vim, see my [`.vimrc`](/.vimrc).
My plugins are managed using [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim). Packer is bootstrapped automatically when you first run the config.
The plugins I use are [here](https://github.com/UnrealApex/dotfiles/blob/main/lua/user/core/plugins.lua#L17).
